Exploratory Data Analysis allows analysts to understand the content of the data used, ranging from distribution, frequency, correlation and others. In general, EDA is carried out in several ways:

Univariate Analysis — descriptive analysis with one variable.
Bivariate Analysis — analysis of a relationship with two variables usually with the target variable.
Multivariate Analysis — analysis that uses more than or equal to three variables.
In this case, you are asked to see the distribution of:

The percentage of Churn data distribution and whether or not from all data
Indiscriminate data from predictor variable to label (Churn)
